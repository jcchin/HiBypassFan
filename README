HiBypassFan Model:

This model is intended to run inside the Matlab NPSS S-function



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   Startup
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) Open CMD window with NPSS Environment
2) Navigate to Matlab path, execute matlab.exe
3) Inside Matlab, navigate to HiBypassModel, add 'bin' and 'DLMComponents\nt' to path

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   Running
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) Open fanjet_simulink.slx

The input file is fanjet.run.

You must include the paths to the DLMs and InterpIncludes.  

Easy runnpss script way, assumes runnpss is in PATH:
runnpss fanjet.run

Explicit way on Linux:
$NPSS_TOP/bin/npss.$NPSS_CONFIG -I$NPSS_TOP/InterpIncludes -I$NPSS_TOP/DLMComponents/$NPSS_CONFIG fanjet.run

Explicit way on Windows:
%NPSS_TOP%\bin\npss.nt -I%NPSS_TOP%\InterpIncludes -I%NPSS_TOP%\DLMComponents\nt fanjet.run


The pageviewer output goes to viewOut, and the transient output goes to tout
